# My Cruise Company Case Study
 Capstone Project for TEK Bootcamp

## Inspiration
I created this project to test and further my knowledge in the Back End side of Web Development. Using a server and database would have greatly expanded the scope of what I could have done with past projects. Cruises are also my preferred choice for a relaxing vacation. 

## About
This is a simple website designed as a proof of concept for a functioning cart system. It allows customers to easily register an account, login to that account, view listed cruises and add them to their name. Afterwards they may view their selected cruises in their cart and may even choose to remove any of those selected cruises. With all changes being saved into a MySQL database. There is also an Admin page where a user can add, remove, modify, or delete both Cruises and Customers. The page is protected by Spring Security and requires a correct username and password to access. 

## Technologies Used
Java 8 was the main programming language for this project.
   1. Admin Page (Thymeleaf, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JUnit)
   2. B2B (Maven, REST, JSON)
   3. Main Webpage (Spring MVC, Hibernate, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) 
   4. Database (MySQL)
